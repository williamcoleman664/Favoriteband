        <h2>Music Style</h2>

          <p>The Eden Project, which is Jonathon Ng, is classified as an electronic producer making atmospheric indie electronic music. Ng had an interview with Status and said
            <br></br>
              <i>"Honestly I don't really mind how people lable my music and if they can't put one name on it, maybe that's a good thing."</i>
            <br></br>
              I personally like not only the electronic style his produces, but also his voice.
